Description: C-Tools can produce input files of various applications for density functional theory (DFT) calculations via user-friendly parameter adjustment using three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) and graphical user interfaces (GUI). Input-file conversion between different applications is also possible.  Supported DFT codes are xTAPP, OpenMX, and VASP.
